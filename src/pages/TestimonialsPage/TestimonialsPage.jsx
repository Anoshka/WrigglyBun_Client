    text: "I was in search of a photographer for my maternity shoot. That is when I got to know about WigglyBun Photography. From the first day of inquiry till now Anandita has been extremely sweet and passionate. She made me and my family comfortable during the shoot. The day of the shoot was very well paced which was really a big relief for me. She is very passionate and compatible person. Her love towards capturing the expression from behind the lens added additional beauty to the pictures. All the pictures came out well and very affordable too. Loved her work. Waiting for the newborn shoot with WigglyBun Photography. Much love to you Anandita. Keep up the good work you are doing. I would strongly suggest her if you are looking for your maternity shoot as well as newborn shoot in and around Bangalore.",

    text: "We had the pleasure of working with Anandita for a photo shoot of our 20-day-old baby, and we couldnâ€™t be happier with the experience. Anandita was incredibly caring and gentle throughout the entire session. Despite multiple changes of dress and wrapping, our baby remained comfortable and undisturbed, which speaks volumes about her skill and patience. Baby photoshoots require a lot of patience and a calm demeanor, and Anandita managed it all beautifully. She delivered stunning shots that we will cherish forever. We highly recommend Anandita for anyone looking for a talented and compassionate photographer for their little ones.",
